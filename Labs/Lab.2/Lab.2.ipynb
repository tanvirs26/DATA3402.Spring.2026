Test your solution and demonstrate that it works as explect.

    "ChatGPT suggested a function with the parameter of board, which is already defined earlier to be a 3 x 3 matrix. n is defined to be the length of the board (n=3). The program consists of loops to check the columns, rows, and diagnals of the board to see if there is a win in each segment of the board. First loop checks each row and for each spot in one row, the program checks to see if it is not empty (!= 0). The row is assumed to be a winning row of one of the squared is not empty. Then every square in that row is checked. If any square in that row is different from the first square, the win is set to false. If there is a win, the player number that is won is returned (1 or 2). The same is done for each column and for the diagonals. Then we check if the game is still going by checking every square on the board and if any square is empty, -1 is returned meaning the game is not finished. Otherwise, there is a draw and 0 is returned."
